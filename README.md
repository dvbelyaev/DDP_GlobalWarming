# Global Warming's Data Visualization

Developing Data Products - Course Project

These presentation and application were produced for the homework assignment of Developing Data Products course from Johns Hopkins University - https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/

## Problem Description

- Global Warming is the increase of the average temperature of Earth's climate system. The term Global Warming is often used to refer to the average temperature of the land surface.

- The described application illustrates the change of the global average temperature in different countries.

## Datasets

- The raw dataset GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv was taken from the dataset's archive in the Kaggle Datasets repository - https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data.

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (NA's omitting and calculating the annual average temperatures) was done by the script - https://github.com/dvbelyaev/DDP_GlobalWarming/blob/master/preproc.R

- The many other datasets devoted to the problems of Climate change and Global Warming are available at the Berkeley Earth data repository - http://berkeleyearth.org/data/

Hope you enjoy using the app.

Thank you!
